# serial-terminal
A tool for monitoring serial ports of your computer
==========================================================================================================
Nowadays, all of the devices that you are using, use serial interface for their communications.
For exxample, if you have worked with arduino or other electronical modules that they support
UART serial interface, you'll need a tool for communicating with them.
There are so many terminals on the web and all of them have their own pros and cons.
In this project, I created a simple and useful terminal. It doesn't have different parts
that can make you confused. And also that's so powerfull. Befor creating this project, I used to use
Hyper terminal or PUTTY for my works, but each of them have some problems that they couldn't answer my
needs. For example, they don't have enough buffer size for recieving characteres. But I tried to increase
the buffer size of my own terminal as much as possible.
You can change the code based on your needs and your interests.

Please help me develop myself in programming with your feedbacks.
Thank you!
